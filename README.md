<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



In this project, we focus on quantifying model learning as a function of random_state value by investigating the effects of the different random_states values on model performance, reducing bias which occurs during data collection and the robustness of the model in general. We specifically perform a controlled study on the effect of random_state values on the behaviour of attention, gradient-based and MSE based on interpretations. Our analysis suggests that random_state can adversely affect the errors of models resulting in counterfactual interpretations. We propose a technique in which the dataset is split with various values of random_state in a specific range. The dataset is artificially generated by us with normal distribution and fixed covariance between features. The experiment is run on different sizes of datasets by training three regression based models to show its variation with the random_state value.

### Prerequisites


  ```sh
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```





<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Run /scripts/dataset_gen.py for generating datasets
```sh
  python3 dataset_gen.py
  ```
The datasets are stored in the data folder.

Run /scripts/infer.py for training the models, generating plots, and running cross validations.
```sh
  python3 infer.py
  ```
